# FEA Final Project Senior Year Mechanical Engineering


It is recommended to work within the anaconda framework with these tools.

Install anaconda using this link: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.



The ```calculation.py``` contains code that represents the physcial scenarios presented: Heat applied along a 2 dimensional surface. 




The paper ```Using_machine_learning_for_computational_fluid_dynamics.pdf``` describes the break down of the equations and how the data is collected. 
The equation is derived from physical principles and the equation is referred to as Fourier's Heat Equation.


The file ```Presentation_for_GSU_Research_Symposium_Fluid_Analysis.pdf``` is the poster that Dr. Emil created and that I added content to and presented.  

 

To run:


```conda create -n envname python=3.8 anaconda```


```conda activate envname```


```git clone https://github.com/benjaminbrown038/FEA-Final-Project.git```



```cd FEA-Final-Project```



``` pip install -r requirements.txt```


```python3 calculation.py```



Future work: 

- Bring R code that Dr. Emil programmed back into this repo 


- Feed data to a machine learning model
