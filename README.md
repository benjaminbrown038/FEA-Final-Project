# FEA Final Project Senior Year Mechanical Engineering

The ```main.py``` file contains code that represents the physcial scenarios presented: Heat applied along a 2 dimensional surface. 


The paper ```Using_machine_learning_for_computational_fluid_dynamics.pdf``` describes the break down of the equations and how the data is collected. 
The equation is derived from physical principles and the equation is referred to as Fourier's Heat Equation.
