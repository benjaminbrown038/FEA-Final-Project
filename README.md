# FEA Final Project Senior Year Mechanical Engineering


It is recommended to work within the anaconda framework with these tools.

Install anaconda using this link: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.

After installing, install the version of python that we will be using in this demo.

Next, create the virtual environment with anaconda and the version of python that was downloaded (python3.8).

Next, use the git clone command to clone the project locally. Once cloned, create a virtual environment using anaconda. The conda create -n envname python=3.8 anaconda command will accomplish this, with 'envname' being anything of the user's choosing.

Once the environment is created, next we need to activate it using conda activate envname .



The ```calculation.py``` contains code that represents the physcial scenarios presented: Heat applied along a 2 dimensional surface. 




The paper ```Using_machine_learning_for_computational_fluid_dynamics.pdf``` describes the break down of the equations and how the data is collected. 
The equation is derived from physical principles and the equation is referred to as Fourier's Heat Equation.


The file ```Presentation_for_GSU_Research_Symposium_Fluid_Analysis.pdf``` is the poster that Dr. Emil created and that I added content to and presented.  

 

To run:

```git clone https://github.com/benjaminbrown038/FEA-Final-Project.git```


```cd FEA-Final-Project```


```python3 calculation.py```
