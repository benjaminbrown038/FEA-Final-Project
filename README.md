# FEA Final Project Senior Year Mechanical Engineering

The ```calculation.py``` contains code that represents the physcial scenarios presented: Heat applied along a 2 dimensional surface. 




The paper ```Using_machine_learning_for_computational_fluid_dynamics.pdf``` describes the break down of the equations and how the data is collected. 
The equation is derived from physical principles and the equation is referred to as Fourier's Heat Equation.


The file ```Presentation_for_GSU_Research_Symposium_Fluid_Analysis.pdf``` is the poster that Dr. Emil created and that I added content to and presented.  

 

To run:

```git clone https://github.com/benjaminbrown038/FEA-Final-Project.git```


```cd FEA-Final-Project```


```python3 calculation.py```
